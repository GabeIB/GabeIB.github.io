					<h3 class="title">Additive VST Synthesizer Prototype : A Short Demo</h3>
					<h3 class="date">October 11, 2020</h3>
				</div>
				<p>In the following video, I give a brief demo of an additive synthesizer VST prototype that I made. The synth is written in C++ using the JUCE framework. Alone, the synthesizer is a basic sine wave additive synth - the defining feature of the VST is the intuitive interface for drawing envelopes, and the ability to generate independent amplitude envelopes for each partial. Additionally, I wrote a Python package for the synth that allows a user to programatially generate control data for the additive synth. I have used the synthesizer and the Python package to implement a synthesis technique called Oscillator Bank Resynthesis, though this is only one such possible use for an additive synthesizer with a Python interface. Because of the ability to programatically generate control data for the synthesizer, I believe this tool could be useful to those interested in sound.</p>

				I plan on writing a more detailed and technical explanation of the synthesizer's Python interface, as well as a bit about Oscillator Bank Resynthesis in the future.
